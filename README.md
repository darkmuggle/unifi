# Ubiquiti Networks Unifi Controller

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/jdoss/unifi/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/jdoss/unifi)

This is a repo for building and running a Fedora based container for the Ubiquiti Networks Unifi Controller with [Podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod).

- **Version:** 5.11.31-ad89aa3621
- **SHA256:**  0d6a68f71e5c83f33ee89dc95279487ad505c0119b5c7166bbf7431b1a0b7fe9
- **Unifi Forum URL:** https://community.ui.com/releases/UniFi-Network-Controller-5-11-31/c7f8a8a0-0414-4324-a567-1f2b3cb6affa

## See upstream

This is my personal fork. [Please see Mr. Joe Doss' work](https://github.com/jdoss/unifi)

## Why fork

I wanted to stash my configuration in the public. I use a seperate network, 192.168.3.0/24 for my home network infra containers, so I run it a bit differently. Further, I run my controller full time.
